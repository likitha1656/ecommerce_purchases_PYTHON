# Ecommerce Purchases - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an ecommerce purchases dataset using Python and pandas. The dataset includes various columns such as Address, Lot, AM/PM, Browser Info, Company, Credit Card, Email, Job, IP Address, Language, and Purchase Price. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns in customer behavior based on different attributes.

## What We Did:
1. **Top 5 Email Providers**: Analyzed the most common email providers used by customers to make purchases.
2. **AM or PM Purchases**: Analyzed purchase distribution based on the time of day (AM or PM).
3. **Top 5 IP Addresses**: Investigated the most common IP addresses used to make purchases.
4. **Expiry Dates (2020)**: Analyzed credit card expiry dates and filtered those that expired in 2020.
5. **Top 5 Credit Card Providers**: Identified the top credit card providers, with Mastercard ranking #1.
6. **Top 5 Jobs**: Investigated the most common job titles among the customers.

## Tools Used:
- **Python** (pandas, numpy)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis

## Techniques Applied:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Grouping, sorting, and filtering data
- Aggregation and visualization (if applicable)
- String manipulation using `str.split()` for columns like email addresses
- Date manipulation to filter expired credit cards

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior, highlighting key insights into purchase patterns, preferred payment methods, and demographic information.
